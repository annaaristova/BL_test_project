# BL_test_project

I participated in a volunteer project where I wrote automated tests for a local band's new website: https://www.blacklistband.ru/. I created test plans and test cases to perform functional, UI, and API testing. To establish a simple yet effective system for managing and testing web elements, I applied the Page-Object Model design principle to create an object repository for the web elements accessible on a web page using the TestNG framework. For conducting functional testing, I utilized the Selenium framework and the Selenium WebDriver API to identify and interact with specific elements on the web pages.
